# Optimizing-Bank-Marketing-Campaigns
**Problem Statement:**

There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.

**Objective:**

This project aims to analyze the bank's last marketing campaign to figure out what worked and what didn't. By studying the data, we want to understand why some customers deposited money and others didn't. Using this information, we'll develop strategies to make future campaigns more effective. The goal is to help the bank attract more customers and encourage them to deposit money, ultimately improving their overall success.
